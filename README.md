# Titanic Disaster Survivors Analysis

# Description:

Have tried Machine Learning algorithms on the dataset from kaggle and tried to analyse the data with various machine learning tools.

# Functions/Algorithms:

1. Based on the user data given in the dataset and the past data, this model predicts how many passengers were likely to be survived.
2. Algorithms like XGboosts, k-means, Random forests, Decision tree were used to get the desired outcome
3. Various visualizatio tools such as matplotlib, seaborn where used for the effective understanding via visualization.

# Techniques:

* Classification.
* Clustering.
* Regression for the prediction.

It was supervised machine learning task.

# Output:

* It generates a CSV file with the predictions on the test data
